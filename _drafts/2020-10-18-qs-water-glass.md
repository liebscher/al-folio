All participants were asked to rate estimated satiation (ES) and intake (EI) on Visual Analogue Scales for 20 food images, which comprised photographs of ten different dishes placed on large versus small plates.

The results showed that the plate size had significant effects on ES (F (1, 1986) = 19.14, p < 0.001) and EI (F (1,1986) = 5.25; p = 0.048), with the small plate associated with higher ES and lower EI than the large plate. Significant differences in ES and EI were also evident across the weight groups (ES: F (1,1986) = 4.26, p = 0.039; EI: F (1,1986) = 42.22, p < 0.001), with the normal‐weight group reported higher ES and lower EI than the overweight group. Furthermore, the weight group and the plate‐size‐effect were found to be involved in a significant interaction for EI. Post‐hoc tests showed that the plate size only had a significant effect for the normal‐weight group (p < 0.05), but not for the overweight group.

Consistently, short-term studies have demonstrated that increasing portion size leads to increased food intake in adults and children, a phenomenon known as the portion size effect. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. Understanding these mechanisms could assist in clarifying the relationship between portion size and weight status and help inform the development of effective obesity interventions. First, we review the role of visual cues, such as plate size, unit, and utensil size as a potential moderator of the portion size effect. In addition, we discuss meal microstructure components including bite size, rate, and frequency, as these may be altered in response to different portion sizes.

Our tentative findings suggest that individual differences in cognitive (e.g. loss of control eating) and neural responses to food cues may be critical in understanding the mechanisms of the portion size effect. To advance this research area, studies that integrate measures of individual subject-level differences with assessment of food-related characteristics are needed.

They ate most of the cereal they took, so as flake size was reduced, breakfast energy intake increased from a mean±standard error of the mean of 286±18 kcal to 358±19 kcal, an increase of a mean±standard error of the mean 34%±7% (P<0.0001). These findings demonstrate that variations in food volume associated with the size of a food's individual pieces affect the portion served, which in turn affects energy intake.

As examples of reference values for drinking water consumption, World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted 2 L as a standard quantity of daily consumption of drinking water for adults,6 while European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently suggested using 2 L for females and 2.5 L for males for total daily water consumption from beverages and food.7 A reference value may be sufficient for risk assessment in general, but international studies have shown that the average drinking water consumption for adults range between 0.075 L/day and 3 L/day for adults,8, 9, 10, 11 showing both national and regional differences

Despite the seemingly ubiquitous admonition to “drink at least eight 8-oz glasses of water a day” (with an accompanying reminder that beverages containing caffeine and alcohol do not count), rigorous proof for this counsel appears to be lacking. This review sought to find the origin of this advice (called “8 × 8” for short) and to examine the scientific evidence, if any, that might support it.

No scientific studies were found in support of 8 × 8. Rather, surveys of food and fluid intake on thousands of adults of both genders, analyses of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals, strongly suggest that such large amounts are not needed because the surveyed persons were presumably healthy and certainly not overtly ill. This conclusion is supported by published studies showing that caffeinated drinks (and, to a lesser extent, mild alcoholic beverages like beer in moderation) may indeed be counted toward the daily total...

It is to be emphasized that the conclusion is limited to healthy adults in a temperate climate leading a largely sedentary existence, precisely the population and conditions that the “at least” in 8 × 8 refers to. Equally to be emphasized, lest the message of this review be misconstrued, is the fact (based on published evidence) that large intakes of fluid, equal to and greater than 8 × 8, are advisable for the treatment or prevention of some diseases and certainly are called for under special circumstances, such as vigorous work and exercise, especially in hot climates.
