# Introduction

Argument: The Trump Administration is Tyrannical

In this essay I hope to frame the Trump Administration with principles derived from John Locke's *Second Treatise on Government*, a foundational piece in the development of Western democracy. I will introduce Locke's perspective on virtuous government, especially his remarks on tyranny and despotic government.

John Locke in his *Second Treatise on Government*, which was actually a rebuttal to Sir Robert Filmer's *Patriarcha*, rejected the notion of rule by Divine Right and sought to distinguish *just* government from *unjust* government. It is famous for its discussion of natural rights, social contract, and private property in general. Locke was very much devoted to rejecting authoritarianism, and is made clear through the piece. He is not without controversy, for example regarding his short discussion on the place of slavery in society (for which he offers a perhaps surprisingly limited role, and offers little argumentative support for the Afro-American slave trade).

# What is Tyranny?

To begin, I shall introduce a few quotes from Locke. First, from the section *Of Political or Civil Society*, he states movingly:

<blockquote>
    Man being born... with a title to perfect freedom, and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the law of nature, equally with any other man... hath by nature a power, not only to preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men
</blockquote>

This sets well the stage for the rest of the discussion. In particular, Locke is affirming that individuals in society should have an unquestionable right to their own lives, freedom, and land, and this should always be the case and others should not be allowed to break this.

>   for where the power, that is put in any hands for the government of the people... is applied to other ends, and made use of to impoverish, harass, or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular commands of those who have [property]; there it presently becomes tyranny
